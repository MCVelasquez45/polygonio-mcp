This repository contains official examples and demos built by the Massive.com team. These projects showcase how to use our REST and WebSocket APIs to access market data across equities, options, crypto, forex, and more.

## What's Included

- Quickstart demos for different asset classes and API endpoints
- Examples using our client libraries
- Integrations with databases, charting tools, and analytics platforms
- Utility scripts and helper functions

## Getting Started

Most examples require a Massive.com API key. If you need an API key, [sign up here](https://massive.com) to get started. Set it using an environment variable:

```bash
export MASSIVE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

Then follow the README in each example folder for setup instructions.

## Local Development (Three Processes)

1. **Python agent API**
   ```bash
   cd agent
   uv pip install fastapi uvicorn  # first run only
   uvicorn api:app --reload --port 5001
   ```
2. **Express gateway**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Vite React client**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

Each layer reads its own `.env` (see the `.env.example` files) so you can point the Express gateway at the Python host and the client at the gateway.

## Development Startup

```bash
cd agent && uvicorn api:app --reload --port 5001 &
cd server && npm run dev &
cd client && npm run dev &
```
